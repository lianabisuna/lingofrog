## Learnings

Around the time this was developed, I barely remembered the things I studied because I took a break from coding. This app was like a refresher for me especially with CRUD operations and API integrations.

## Screenshots

A colorful and easy-to-navigate interface will greet you as you click the demo link:

## Story

I really love development but a certain part that's really fun is coming up with the name. This app literally went through different names:
- Wourd
- WELP
- Wordly
- 1Word
- Lingua
- Lenguahe
- Langly
- Transl8ed
- 1Lang

## Notes

Since the API is free, there will be a 10-minute alert popup once you exceed the data retrieval time limit.
